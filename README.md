## Welcome to Being Fed Up

Being Fed Up is a podcast I began making during early 2020 as a platform to express my thoughts, and opinions about various factors in the world. Since then it has gradually evolved from a slightly planned podcast to a stream of consciousness and freeform speaking style. There are currently 6 episode with plans for more.
